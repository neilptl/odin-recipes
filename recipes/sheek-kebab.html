            <li>Mince the chicken finely with knife or directly mince it in the food processor or mixer grinder.</li>
            <li>Transfer the minced chicken and chopped onions to a mixing bowl, further add freshly chopped mint and coriander leaves, powdered spices, Salt & pepper to taste and ghee, mix and combine well.</li>
            <li>Make space in between and place a bowl, place a live charcoal in the centre and add few drops of ghee, cover and smoke for 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Dip your hands in water to prevent the chicken mixture sticking to your palms while shaping it over a bamboo skewers, if you have steel skewers please use them as well.</li>
            <li>Make as many as you wish and grill them.</li>
            <li>Set a pan on medium heat, add ghee and grill the seekh from all sides until golden brown in colour. You can also grill them on open fire and do apply ghee or butter at regular interval for getting the golden colour as well as charred flavour.</li>
